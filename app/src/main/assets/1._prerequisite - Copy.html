                        Generally we treat Line Follower Robots as autonomous so there is no need to mention Autonomous Line Follower Robot. Line Follower Robots follows a line on a surface. The way the bot follows the line depends on the algorithm we provide. Even if we may have some serious hardware would still be failed if we can not write the codes properly. Line Follower Robots mainly design, hardware and software dependent.

                        There could be various types of track to run a line follower on. Advantage on a tricky line following track is inversely proportional to the size of your bot. Keep in mind to make the bot as small as possible.
