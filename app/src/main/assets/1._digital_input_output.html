								<h2>Blinking an LED</h2>
							</header>
							<p> The LED blinking sketch is the first program that you should run to test
whether your Arduino board is working and is configured correctly. It is also
usually the very first programming exercise someone does when learning to program a microcontroller. A light-emitting diode (LED) is a small
electronic component that’s a bit like a light bulb, but is more efficient and
requires lower voltages to operate. </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Your Arduino board comes with an LED preinstalled. It’s marked “L”. You
can also add your own LED—connect it as shown in Figure.
If you intend to keep the LED lit for a long period of time, you should
use a resistor.
K indicates the cathode (negative), or shorter lead; A indicates the anode
(positive), or longer lead.
                    </p>
                    
                    <img src="images/1.png" width="100%"></img>
                
                <img src="images/2.png" width="100%"></img>

                    <p>
                        
                        Now that the code is in your IDE, you need to verify that it is correct. Press
the “Verify” button; if everything is correct,
you’ll see the message “Done compiling” appear at the bottom of the
Arduino IDE. This message means that the Arduino IDE has translated
your sketch into an executable program that can be run by the board, a
bit like an .exe file in Windows or an .app file on a Mac.
At this point, you can upload it into the board: press the Upload to I/O
Board button. This will reset the board, forcing it to stop
what it’s doing and listen for instructions coming from the USB port. The
Arduino IDE sends the current sketch to the board, which will store it in
                        its memory and eventually run it. </p> <p>

You will see a few messages appear in the black area at the bottom of the
window, and just above that area, you’ll see the message “Done uploading” appear to let you know the process has completed correctly. There
are two LEDs, marked RX and TX, on the board; these flash every time
a byte is sent or received by the board. During the upload process, they
keep flickering.

								<h2>The Code Step By Step</h2>
							</header>
                    <p><b> // Example 01 : Blinking LED </b> </p> <p>
A comment is a useful way for us to write little notes. The preceding title
comment just reminds us that this program, Example 01, blinks an LED. </p>
                    
                    
                    </p><p>
                    
<p>
    
   <b> const int LED = 13; // LED connected to
       // digital pin 13 </b>
                        </p><p>
const int means that LED is an integer number that can’t be changed (i.e.
a constant) whose value is set to 13. It’s like an automatic search and replace for your code; in this case, it’s telling Arduino to write the number 13
every time the word LED appears. We are using this command to specify
that the LED we’re blinking is connected to the Arduino pin 13.
    
                    </p>

                
                <p>
                    void setup()
This line tells Arduino that the next block of code will be called setup().
{
With this opening curly bracket, a block of code begins
                    
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // sets the digital
// pin as output
Finally, a really interesting instruction. pinMode tells Arduino how to configure a certain pin. Digital pins can be used either as INPUT or OUTPUT.
In this case, we need an output pin to control our LED, so we place the
number of the pin and its mode inside the parentheses.
pinMode is a function, and the words (or numbers) specified inside the
parentheses are arguments. INPUT and OUTPUT are constants in the
Arduino language. (Like variables, constants are assigned values, except
that constant values are predefined and never change.)
                    
                </p>
                        
                <p>
                    }
This closing curly bracket signifies the end of the setup() function.
                </p>
                
<p>void loop()
{
loop() is where you specify the main behaviour of your interactive device.
It will be repeated over and over again until you switch the board off.
    
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // turns the LED on
As the comment says, digitalWrite() is able to turn on (or off) any pin that
has been configured as an OUTPUT. The first argument (in this case, LED)
specifies which pin should be turned on or off (remember that LED is a
constant value that refers to pin 13, so this is the pin that’s switched). The
second argument can turn the pin on (HIGH) or off (LOW).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Imagine that every output pin is a tiny power socket, like the ones you
have on the walls of your apartment. European ones are 230 V, American
ones are 110 V, and Arduino works at a more modest 5 V. The magic here
is when software becomes hardware. When you write digitalWrite(LED,
HIGH), it turns the output pin to 5 V, and if you connect an LED, it will light
up. So at this point in your code, an instruction in software makes something happen in the physical world by controlling the flow of electricity to
the pin. Turning on and off the pin at will now let us translate these into
something more visible for a human being; the LED is our actuator.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    delay(1000); // waits for a second
Arduino has a very basic structure. Therefore, if you want things to happen
with a certain regularity, you tell it to sit quietly and do nothing until it is
time to go to the next step. delay() basically makes the processor sit
there and do nothing for the amount of milliseconds that you pass as
an argument. Milliseconds are thousandths of seconds; therefore, 1000
milliseconds equals 1 second. So the LED stays on for one second here.
                    
                </p>
                
                
                <p>
                    digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // turns the LED off
This instruction now turns off the LED that we previously turned on. Why
do we use HIGH and LOW? Well, it’s an old convention in digital electronics.
HIGH means that the pin is on, and in the case of Arduino, it will be set at
5 V. LOW means 0 V. You can also replace these arguments mentally with
ON and OFF.
                    
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    delay(1000); // waits for a second
Here, we delay for another second. The LED will be off for one second.
}
This closing curly bracket marks end of the loop function.
                    
                </p>
